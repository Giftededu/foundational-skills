**Open Science - "WHY?"**

- Promotes a more accurate verification of scientific results. 
- Speeds up scientific inquiry and discovery 
- Reduces duplication in collecting, creating, transferring, and re-using scientific material.
- Increases efficient use of financial resources.
- Results in innovation and increased consumer choice from public research.
- Promotes citizens’ engagement and trust in science.

This framework incorporates access to data and information, as well as civil society engagement, in the different stages of the scientific research process. 

It is not meant to be prescriptive but should help different communities to decide on their own priorities within the open science space and to better visualize how these priorities link to different stage of the scientific process and to different actors. 

Such a framework can be useful also in considering how best to incentive's and measure different aspects of open science.

.panel[.panel-name[Discussion]

"Open Science policies encourage researchers to disclose a wide range of outputs from their work, thereby codifying openness as a specific set of research practices and guidelines that can be interpreted and applied consistently across disciplines and geographical settings." (Levin, N., & Leonelli, S. (2017). 

How do you "open" science in your practice?

Piekert et al. exclaims that computational reproducibility is the ability to obtain identical results from the **same data** with the **same computer code**

# Reproducible Research

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Why?]

.center[
<img src="img/reprod_1.png" height="400px"/>
]


]

???
Reproducibility is integral for empirical results. 

Reproducible Research has shown to 
Increase:
- Study replication
- Cumulative knowledge development
- Work habits 
- Teamwork
- Ease of revision to a project/study
- Higher impact research

Reduces:
- Effort duplication

Even with open science advancements projects fail to be reproduced by other researchers due to software dependencies, ambiguous documentation of exact computational steps, copy and paste errors and poor best practices.

.panel[.panel-name[What?]

**Core Practices**

“The **communication** aspect **should not be an afterthought**, it should be recorded with your analysis as you are going through it.” (-Harrison et al, 2020)
.center[
<img src="img/reprod_2.png" height="300px"/>
]
]

???

Well-documented research
- ReadMe file
- Use of code books - (variables, qual codes defined)
- Validation procedures
- Inclusion criteria 
- Research questions
- Considering including rough abstract
Clear communication
- Explanatory headers for source code files
- Code is well commented (#)
- Plain language
- Rationale for using functions and methods 
“Reproducible Theory”
- Foundation works and proofs cited appropriately

Piekert et al. 2021 and Gandrud 2020 suggest following a Workflow for reproducibility to achieve long-term and cross-platform computational reproducibility of data analysis.
Piekert et al.s workflow includes 
1. Version control
2. Dynamic document generating
3. Dependency Tracking
4. Software management

while Gandrud's includes

# R Programming Basics

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[R Environment]

.center[
<img src="img/r_console.png" height="425px"/>
]

]
???
**What is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?**
The IDE four main areas
- Console (& Terminal)
- Scripting and Viewing Window
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help
- Environment (& Connections/Git)

**CONSOLE:**
The console will show you what items have been run and any errors
The terminal provides access to the system shell. You can run scripts here

***Scripting and Viewing:**
The Script Window is the place to enter and run your code so that it is easily edited and saved for future use.
Two ways to execute your code in the R script, you can either highlight the code and click on Run, or you can highlight the code and press CTRL + Enter on your keyboard.

**Environment Window:**
The Environment tab allows you to see what objects are in the work space.
The history tab allows you to see the commands that you have entered.

.panel[.panel-name[Global Options]

.center[
<img src="img/global.png" height="425px"/>
]
]
???


**Global options:**
customize the IDE to better suite your workflow
- wrap code
- change color scheme
- move panes around
- so much more


.panel[.panel-name[New Script]
.center[
<img src="img/r_script.png" height="425px"/>
]
???

Let's set up our Global Options for a smooth workflow
- In the menu bar click `Tools` then `Global Options.`
    + 1. `R General` -> (untick) Restore .RData into workspace at startup.
    + 2. `R General` -> Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never
    + 3. `R Markdown` -> Show output preview in: Viewer Pane
]
.panel[.panel-name[Programming]
- Objects are the nouns of the R language
	+ owen_meany < - mean(numeric_vector)
- Functions are the verbs
	+ owen_meany < - mean(numeric_vector)
- Arguments are the adverbs or the direct object
	+ owen_meany < - mean(numeric_vector)
As in any sentence, there is also “punctuation” 
	+ owen_meany < - mean(numeric_vector)

# Functions

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Functions]

.center[
<img src="img/functions.png" height="425px"/>
]
]

???
Functions: are everything you do in R. 

.panel[.panel-name[Structure]
- mean()
- filter()


```{r round-block, echo=TRUE}
#round pi
round(3.14) #<<

```

]
]
???
Say you want to take the mean of a number, you would write mean( )
Suppose you want to round a number, you would use round( ) and put the number inside the parentheses. Make sure to look in the console pane to see the answer.
- Functions always include parenthesis

---
# Arguments

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Arguments]

.center[
<img src="img/arguments.png" height="425px"/>
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Structure]

```{r argument-block, echo = TRUE}
#use help to look at arguments
?round

#round pi to two digits
round(3.14, digits = 2) #<<
```

]

???
- We talked about the help window or pane earlier. You can add a question mark before the round() function to look at the arguments. 

- Look for an argument that you can add to pi to round to the nearest 1 decimal places
HINT look under USAGE in the arguments help section

]

# Objects
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Objects]

.center[
<img src="img/objects.png" height="425px"/>
]
Objects: are everything you have in R - things that you save like data frames in tabular form. Think back when you have used excel and you had to save your spread sheet and name it. That is comparable to an object. 

To save something into an object we need to use the assignment operator <-.  The assignment operator is used for assignment operation. Operator that assigns a certain value to a variable and scope is within the function and outside as well. 

???

]
.panel[.panel-name[Structure]
```{r object-block, echo=TRUE}
twenty <-20 #<<
forty <- 20 #<<

```

]
]
???


We will save the number 20 to the word twenty. I could have easily called the new object any other name to save as the object. Then I can **call** the number by typing twenty in and running it.

Don’t ever want to use TRUE/FALSE, those are reserved for testing logical variables.
Also, NaN, inf and NA are reserved for outcomes such as whether a variable is negative or positive infinity, not a number, or missing.

#Packages

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Packages]

.center[
<img src="img/packages.png" height="425px"/>
]

]
???
You only install the package once, ever...mostly ever :). But, you will need to read in the package to Rstudio for each session. Sometimes during the session.

There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics, and machine learning. If you need r to do something then there's probably a package for that.

.panel[.panel-name[Structure]

1.  Download packages to computer with `intall.packages("")`.
2.  Read in package to Rstudio with `library()`

```{r install-code, echo=TRUE}


# read in tidyverse, do not need quotations reading into script
library(tidyverse) #<<
```
