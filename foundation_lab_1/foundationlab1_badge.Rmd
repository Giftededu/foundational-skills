The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of one of the data structures we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What type of data structure is analyzed in the educational context?

    -   

3.  What ties connect these actors and how are they represented visually?

    -   

4.  Why were these relations of interest to the researcher?

    -   

5.  Finally, what makes this collection of actors a social network?

    -   

Draft a research question for a population you may be interested in studying, or that would be of interest to educational researchers, and that would require the collection of relational data and answer the following questions:

1.  What relational data would need to be collected?

    -   

2.  For what reason would relational data need to be collected in order to address this question?

    -   

3.  Explain the analytical level at which these data would need to be collected and analyzed.

    -   

4.  How does this differ from the ways in which individual or group behavior is typically conceptualized and modeled in conventional educational research?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

Using one of the data sets provided in your data folder, **your goal for this lab is to create a polished sociogram that visually represents this network.** For example, you may be interested in examining how shared characteristics among school leaders might help explain tie formation, such as gender, level of trust in colleagues, or whether they work at the school or district level.

**Alternatively, you may use your own data set to estimate models akin to those we estimated in the guided practice.** 

I highly recommend creating a new R script in your lab-1 folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share the final code for your model and answer the questions that follow.

```{r, my-data-product}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
```

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Intro to SNA Badge! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review by

1.  Click the yarn icon above to "knit" your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.
2.  Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.
3.  Locate and copy the link to your GitHub web page ([See here for instructions](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-free-github-pages-website-53743d7524e1)).
4.  Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [SNA Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/network-analysis/discussions/1). In your post, include a link to your published web page and a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you'd like to explore further.
