# Recap from Data Structures Presentation

- Types of Data Used in LA (Sources)
- Characteristics of Data (Format)

???

Before we go on lets take just a few minutes, how are you all feeling so far?
On a quick recap from our data structures presentation we discussed the different types of fata found commonly in Learning Analytics. 

**Types of Data** included:

- Digital Learning Environments
  + games 
  + learning management systems
  + Intelligent tutoring systems
  + MOOCs
- Administrative Data
  + Student information Systems
  + statewide longitudinal data systems
- Sensors and Multimodal
  + Sensors
  + Combination and Research

**Characteristics of Data** included:
- Structured
  + Quantitative and relational
- Unstructured
  + Qualitative in nature and un-relational
- Semi-Structured
  + Quantitative and Triangular
- Meta-Data
+ Quantitative, data about data.

Krumm et al postulates "a workflow is a set of processes that transform inputs into outputs across multiple steps and decisions." 
Documented from Guo, 2012; Wickham & Grolemund, 2017; and Marsh 2012, this generic workflow is intended to support *researchers, practitioners, and data scientists* prepare for a data-intensive analysis and communicate one’s findings.

Being prepared for a data-intensive analysis involves clear and refined research questions with an understanding of where the data came from. 
For example Krumm et al uses the example surrounding an activity system for which the technology was used. Is it for instructional, reward or even a social collaborative context? Having that understanding will allow for more refined understanding when formulating guiding research questions for the analysis. Identify what gets collected and stored by technology is important for the development of the research question.
Here you may even refine your research question after having a better idea of where the data came from. The question may also be refined and redeveloped after you have started the data intensive analysis.
The Learning Analysis Cycle is not a linear process but rather a process of phases that can be moved around.

Wrangling or sometimes called "munging or pre-processing" entails the work of manipulating, cleaning, transforming, and merging data.
- **manipulating** involves identifying, acquiring, and importing data into analysis software.
- Wickham & Grolemund suggest cleaning data involves ensuring that each variable is in its own column, each observation is in its own row, and each value
is in its own cell within a dataset.
  + Krumm et al add that **data cleaning** also involves identifying and remediating missing data, extreme values, and ensuring consistent use of identifier, key, or linking variables.
-  transforming variables, such as recoding
categorical variables and rescaling continuous variables.   + These types of transformations are the initial building blocks for exploratory data analysis
-  One of the biggest value add ons is merging once disparate data sources is 
  + EX: merging data from a student information system that stores student grades with data from a digital learning environment that stores students’ longitudinal interactions can unlock what student do and do not do on a day to day basis.

In the reading and according to Behren's, 

*How do we build rich mental models of the phenomena being examined?*

Right, by discovering patterns in the data and graphically representing the variables.
The exploratory data analysis phase includes:
- Data visualization:
  + Graphically representing one or more variables
  + Allows for discovery of patterns in data and formation of mental models
- Feature engineering
  + Creating new variables within a data set
    + Draws on:
    + Knowledge from theory or practice
    + Experience with a particular data system
    + General experience in data-intensive research

Moseling is used to develop a mathematical summary of relationships within a dataset. 
It is an iterative process that involves building and evaluating the model.
Two models - Unsupervised and supervised.
- Unsupervised learning
  + Exploratory
  + Used to understand the structure of one’s dataset 
  + Also called, structure discovery, algorithms are useful for understanding relationships among features in a dataset.

- Supervised learning
  + Predictive modeling
  + Quantifies relationships between features and a known outcome
  + Classification - model categorical outcomes (e.g., yes or no outcomes)
  + Regression - characterize continuous outcomes (e.g., test scores)
  +  Supervised learning models are different in
that they can be used to quantify relationships between features and a known outcome p.46
