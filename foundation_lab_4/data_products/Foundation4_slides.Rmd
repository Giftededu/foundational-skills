# Purpose of Data Visualizations

Looking at data graphed visualization may be easy to understand but it can be messy.
This visualization looks at Twitter sentiment of four popular Learning Management Systems. 

Looking at the the frequency table it is hard to get a good sense of the twitter sentiment for each LMS.

In the the visualization we can quickly see that it looks as though Blackboard had the most positive scores. However, when reading the analysis you know that the Twitter counts for Blackboard were the lowest. So, this graph is very informative but requires you to look at all of the analysis for understanding. 

In "Data Science for Education," Estrellado et al. (2020) states," that while this relationship might seem intuitive, you can’t draw a definitive conclusion just from the visualization, because it doesn’t tell you whether the relationship between those variables is meaningful."

???
In the last session we looked at the first two parts of the Learning Analytics Workflow, *Prepare* and *Wrangle.*
In this session we will continue with the *Explore* phase in the LA workflow cycle.

We will also dive the grammar of ggplot. An important package that is used for data visualization.
