# Agenda

.pull-left[**Part-1  Conceptual Overview**
- Storytelling
- Publication-ready products
]

.pull-right[**Part-2  Code-Along**
- Model
- Communicate
- RMarkdown File formats
- Citation Manager in R
- Journal submission

]
???
In this presentation we are going to focus on communicating your data and findings effectively with education stakeholders. We'll also talk about how to create publication-ready products in R markdown. 

For the code along, we will continue on in our Learning Analytics workflow to finish up with Model and Communication. Where we will be  converting R markdown files into a variety of formats and experiment a little bit with setting up a bibliography and formatting in-text citations. And if we have time you may have the opportunity to also experiment with the rticles package to tailor a publication or a document for a specific journal.

???
The final(ish) step in our workflow/process is sharing the results of
analysis with wider audience. Krumm et al.(2018) have outline the
following 3-step process for communicating with education stakeholders
what you have learned through analysis:

1.  **Select**. Communicating what one has learned involves selecting
    among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an
    intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that
    information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form,
    i.e.Â a "data product."

2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products,
    research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by
    adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with
    colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3.  **Narrate**. Writing a narrative to accompany the data products
    involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related
    research question, describing how best to interpret the data
    product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps
    answer the research question.
