## Foundation of Learning Analytics for STEM Education Research

Foundation knowledge is the base knowledge of which new knowledge is built. Learning Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs (Siemens, 2011).

These foundation labs allow for the gentle introduction of conceptual understanding of foundation of learning analytics along with R programming basics for STEM Education Research. 


### **Foundation lab 1** - Data Structures

**Required Pre-Reading:**

[Learning Analytics Goes to School, (Ch. 2, pp. 15 - 28) By Andrew Krumm, Barbara Means, Marie Bienkowski](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/blob/main/foundation_labs/foundlab_1/krumm_2018.pdf)


**Presentation and code-along:**
This presentation is a review of the types of data typically used to perform learning analytics in education. The focus of the essential readings are to introduce LASER Scholars to the most common data structures used in Learning Analytics. We will look closely at Digital Learning Environments, Administrative Data and Sensors / Multimodal. 
The code-along includes introduction of a script file and commonly used packages that read in different data types. Scholars learn to use the readr package from tidyverse to organize data into data frames and tibbles. Additionally, scholars will learn how to read in files using the Haven package.  

Written by Jeanne McClure, Catherine Noonan, and Shaun Kellogg. Presented by Jeanne McClure and Jenn Houchins at the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) workshop, July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022, at the Friday Institute, North Carolina State University.


**Required Work:**

-  Make sure to complete the 1st primer: [R Basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)
-  Complete the badge requirement document [Foundations badge - Data Sources](https://github.com/laser-institute/foundational-skills/tree/master/foundation_lab_1/lab1_badge).



### **Foundation lab 2** - Learning Analytics Workflow


**Required Pre-Reading:**

1. [Learning Analytics Goes to School, (Ch. 2, pp. 28 - 33) By Andrew Krumm, Barbara Means, Marie Bienkowski](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/blob/main/foundation_labs/foundlab_1/krumm_2018.pdf)

2. [R for Data Science. (CH. 9) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)


**Presentation and code-along:**
Learning Analytics. The focus of the essential reading dives deep into the Learning Analytics workflow. The accompanying code-along introduces R Markdown and Markdown syntax, as well as the YAML header. Participants will practice preparing and wrangling data, including reading in and tidying data.

**Required Work:**

-  Make sure to complete the R Programming primer: [Work with Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2))

-  Complete the badge requirement document from your lab 2 folder [foudationlab2_badge - Data Sources](https://github.com/laser-institute/foundational-skills/blob/master/foundation_lab_2/foundationlab2_badge.Rmd).


### **Foundation-lab 3** - Data Visualization

The overview introduces and reviews some of the basic principles of data visualization as it relates to data graphics, including data visualization perception and color.

The accompanying code-along takes a deep dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple-to-understand layering approach. We will look at a representation of numeric variables using some of the most popular geoms, histogram and scatter plot, and put it all together to answer a research question. 
At the end of this code-along participants will understand the "hows" of ggplots aesthetics.

### **Foundation-lab 4** - Data Products

This presentation will cover the essentials of crafting a data product for different stakeholders. Concepts covered include: data storytelling, narrative elements, and methods for improving stakeholder understanding and facilitating resolution or call-to-action. The code-along will focus on using R Markdown to create reports in a variety of formats and will introduce formatting for bibliographies and in-text citations for scholarly publications.
