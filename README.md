# Foundational labs and code-along in STEM Education Research


**Foundation lab 1** - Data Structures

This presentation is a review of types of data typically used to perform learning analytics in education. The focus of the essential readings are to introduce LASER Scholars to the most common data structures used in Learning Analytics. We will look closely at Digital Learning Environments, Administrative Data and Sensors / Multimodal. 
The code-along includes introductionof a script file commonly used packages that read in different data types. Scholars learn to use the readr package from tidyverse to organizing data into data frames and tibbles. Additionally, learning how to read in using the Haven package.  Written by Jeanne McClure, Shaun Kellogg, Presented by Jeanne McClure and Jenn Houchins at the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) workshop, July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022, at the Friday Institute, North Carolina State University.



**Foundation lab 2** - Learning Analytics Workflow

This presentation reviews the learning analytics workflow (prepare, wrangle, explore, model, communicate) and the importance of using it in Learning Analytics. The focus of the essential reading dives deep into the Learning Analytics workflow.

The accompanying code-along introduces R Markdown and Markdown syntax, as well as the YAML header. Participants will practice preparing and wrangling data, including reading in and tidying data.
