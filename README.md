## Foundation labs for STEM Education Research

Foundation knowledge is the base knowledge of which new knowledge is built. Learning Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs (Siemens, 2011).

The foundation labs allow for the gentle introduction of conceptual understanding of learning analytics foundations along with R programming basics. 


**Foundation lab 1** - Data Structures

This presentation is a review of the types of data typically used to perform learning analytics in education. The focus of the essential readings are to introduce LASER Scholars to the most common data structures used in Learning Analytics. We will look closely at Digital Learning Environments, Administrative Data and Sensors / Multimodal. 
The code-along includes introduction of a script file commonly used packages that read in different data types. Scholars learn to use the readr package from tidyverse to organize data into data frames and tibbles. Additionally, learning how to read in using the Haven package.  Written by Jeanne McClure, Shaun Kellogg, Presented by Jeanne McClure and Jenn Houchins at the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) workshop, July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022, at the Friday Institute, North Carolina State University.



**Foundation lab 2** - Learning Analytics Workflow

This presentation reviews the learning analytics workflow (prepare, wrangle, explore, model, communicate) and the importance of using it in Learning Analytics. The focus of the essential reading dives deep into the Learning Analytics workflow.

The accompanying code-along introduces R Markdown and Markdown syntax, as well as the YAML header. Participants will practice preparing and wrangling data, including reading in and tidying data. Written by Jeanne McClure, and Shaun Kellogg, Presented by Jeanne McClure and Jenn Houchins at the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) workshop, July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022, at the Friday Institute, North Carolina State University.

**Foundation-lab 3** - Data Visualization

The presentation overview introduces and reviews some of the basic principals of data visualization as it relates to data graphics. Taking a quick look at data visualization perception and color.

The accompanying code-along takes a deep dive into the ggplot2 grammar in a simple to understand layering approach for some of the most popular geoms. We will look at a representation of numeric variables with a histogram and scatter plot. We will put it all together to answer a research question. At the end of this code-along participants will understand the "how"" of ggplots aesthetics. Written by Jeanne McClure, and Shaun Kellogg.

**Foundation-lab 4** - Data Products



Written by Catherine Noonan, Jeanne McClure, and Shaun Kellogg. Presented by Jeanne McClure and Jenn Houchins at the Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) workshop, July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022, at the Friday Institute, North Carolina State University.
