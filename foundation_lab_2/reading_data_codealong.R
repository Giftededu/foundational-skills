#Continuing on from foundation lab one we will use "good Programming practices" to learn more about reading in data.

# Again we are using a script file in R Studio. You will become fmiliar with R Mardown files later in the day or week. In order to read in data we must load packages that allow us to read data in.

# R comes with several packages when you start a session. Packages are a collection of objects, data sets around a theme or purpose. You may find a package whose objects are for the putpose of correlation, like in the cor package. Or you may find a package that has objects to produce better tables, like in the kableextra package. Or you may find a package that will help wrangling the data (processing it) easier than in Base R package. That is the package we are going to install here Tidyverse.

#Tidyverse is a suite of packages that share a common philosophy and are designed to work together. Think Google products or Microscoft products. data importing, data wrangling and plotting.
