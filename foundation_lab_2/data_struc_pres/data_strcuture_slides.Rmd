# Types of Data Used in LA (Sources)

.panelset[

]

???
Although we are going to talk about these types of data in silo, in practice researchers find value in using them together.
In the following presentation we will introduce a workflow outlining ways which  data  from  multiple  sources  can  be  analyzed, interpreted, and  translated into change.


The types of data show:
- Indicators of a school's success and progress.
- Student progress, student behavior, and student learning.
- Demographic or social media sources.

# Digital Learning Environments

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[DLE]

Digital learning environments include any set
of technology-based methods that can be applied to support learning and instruction. Ifenthaler(2017).

.pull-right[

]
]
???

According to Krumm et al, Digital Learning Environments have fueled data intensive research in education more than any other data.

.panel[.panel-name[Games+]

.pull-left[Games and Simulations:
- Captures real-time interactions
- Cognitive outcomes
- Behavior outcomes
- Affective outcomes

.pull-right[

]
]
???
- Early, iterative user-testing
- help surface basic player interactions for improved core mechanics
- UI/UX and learning design
- Structure discovery and relationship mining

.panel[.panel-name[ITS]

Intelligent Tutoring Systems 
.pull-left[Three types: 
1. An expert, or domain model
2. A student model
3. An instructional, or pedagogical model

Intelligent Tutoring Systems is a type of DLE that applies AI to students interactions in the digital system.

- has three models, an expert, or domain model, which organizes the skills and strategies in the domain, 
a student model of what a student understands about the domain that is inferred from their performances on learning tasks and,
an instructional (pedagogical model) that includes  common mistakes and misconceptions along with a corresponding feedback strategy 


- The same data that the ITS uses to figure out how to respond to a student’s actions can also be used by human analysts to gain a detailed picture of learning processes and the behaviors learners engage in.

.panel[.panel-name[LMS]
Learning Management Systems

A Learning Management System (LMS) is an online integrated software used for creating, delivering, tracking, and reporting educational courses and outcomes. Often used as student-facing repositories of digital resources and activities,


We use Moodle at NCSU. What LMS do you use at your institution?

.panel[.panel-name[MOOCs]
.pull-left[
- Free/freemium courses, certificates, PD
- Edx
- Coursera

???
Raise your hand if you have ever participated in a MOOC? The FI has many free MOOCs available, but there are also EDx and Coursera that you can take a MOOC at. These offer a major source for data from the large numbers of participants.

# Administrative Data

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[A.D.]

Types of State and Federal systems used in schools and districts to collect and store information to deliver some *sort* of service.

.pull-right[
<img src="img/Admin_LA.png" height="300px"/>
]
]
???
Administrative Data is the second type of data fueling data intensive research.
Used in Schools, at district level and throughout most states.

.panel[.panel-name[SIS]

.pull-left[
- Student level - Academic Performance
- Teacher & Administrator facing repository
- Technology-based intervention

]

.pull-right[
<img src="img/Admin_LA.png" height="300px"/>
]
]
???
**Student information systems**
Can be at the Student level or Teacher and Administrator level of student demographic and learning-outcome data.

- A ready source of data on educational outcomes (e.g., grades) and demographic information, which can play a role in evaluations of technology-based interventions as well as early warning system research 


.panel[.panel-name[SLDS]

.pull-left[
- Connects state-wide
- Accountability and reporting

]

.pull-right[
<img src="img/Admin_LA.png" height="300px"/>
]
]
???
**statewide longitudinal data systems**
- standardized test performances, attendance, and major behavioral infractions.
- unique statewide identifier for every student
- Ability to link state K12 with HEd system; storage of each student’s demographic characteristics and enrollment history and scores on state accountability tests
- Data infrastructure to examine “educational outcomes at the scale of an entire state” p.34

State  level  and  university-based  researchers  increasingly  leveraged  these  data  for  both  accountability  and  reporting  purposes  as  well  as  district-and  school-improvement purposes.

# Sensors and Multimodal

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Sensors+]

Location, physical movement and speech data.

.pull-right[

???
How many of you have an apple watch, or a fitbit or Samsung? These watches measure different things surrounding our health and fitness. The data can then be used to explain or predict our **health**

.panel[.panel-name[Research]

.pull-left[
- capture biometric data
- parse audio and video recordings using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques
- Fitness devices
- Multimodal investigation

???

identifying multiple affective and engagement-related states
detect facial expressions(audio, video)
speech recognition
speech prosody

- Understanding  what  learners  do  as  they  engage  in  learning  tasks  can  drive  digital  learning  environment adaptations.

# Characteristics of Data

.panel[.panel-name[Types]


.center[
<img src="img/data_types.png" height="400px"/>

???

In data-intensive research we might acquire data from LMS, SIS or another source. Data maybe to big for a typical  database  software  tools  to  capture,  store,  manage,  and  analyze”

Those data are similar but different because 
1. the tasks that students are engaged in and 
2. how data from those tasks are collected and stored by the technology. 



.panel[.panel-name[Structured]

```{r round-block, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#show first 5 rows
library(tidyverse)
sci_course <- read_csv("data/sci-online-classes.csv")
sci_course%>%
  head(n=5)
```

]
???
Types: Quantitative in nature
Here we see the rows and columns nice and tidy. 
- data is tidy when each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell is a single value.

We typically have tidy data in Excel files or SQL databases that we can import using the readr function or here function.

- Tabular - relational data. 
Examples might include:
- performance data (current and prior)
- demographic data (student’s ethnic and or group or disability)

Each field (variable) is discrete and can be accessed separately or jointly along with data from other fields (variables).

.panel[.panel-name[Unstructured]

.center[
<img src="img/unstructured.png" height="400px"/>

???
Types: Qualitative in nature
Non-Relational Data
sensor data, web logs, clickstreams, keystroke capture data, emails, images and videos

Text Heavy relationships between nodes
IE: Audio, video, dates SQL database

.panel[.panel-name[Semi-Structured]

.center[

```{r sna_plot, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
ties <- read_csv("data/dlt1-edgelist.csv", 
                 col_types = cols(Sender = col_character(),
                                  Receiver = col_character(), 
                                  `Category Text` = col_skip(), 
                                  `Comment ID` = col_character(), 
                                  `Discussion ID` = col_character()))
actors <- read_csv("data/dlt1-nodes.csv", 
                   col_types = cols(UID = col_character(),

                                    connect = col_character()))
network <- graph_from_data_frame(d = ties, 
                                 vertices = actors, 
                                 directed = T) 
E(network)$weight <- 1 
weighted_network <- simplify(network,
                             edge.attr.comb = list(weight="sum")
                             )
node_degree <- degree(weighted_network, mode = "all")
plot(weighted_network,
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.size = node_degree*.1,
     edge.arrow.size = .04)
```

Types - Qualitative data
Triangular Data (uses surveys and interview answers)
Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables.

self-describing structure
contain tags
IE: Social media, JSON and XML

.panel[.panel-name[Meta-Data]

]
???
data about data - contexts and purposes for why the data was collected
IE: fields for dates and locations on a set of photographs
