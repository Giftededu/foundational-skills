# Types of Data Used in LA (Sources)

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Types]

]
]

???
Although we are going to talk about these types of data in silo, in practice researchers find value in using them together.
In the following presentation we will introduce a workflow outlining ways which  data  from  multiple  sources  can  be  analyzed, interpreted, and  translated into change.


The types of data show:
- Indicators of a school's success and progress.
- Student progress, student behavior, and student learning.
- Demographic or social media sources.

# Digital Learning Environments

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[DLE]

Digital learning environments include any set
of technology-based methods that can be applied to support learning and instruction. Ifenthaler(2017).

.pull-right[
<img src="img/digital_LA.png" height="300px"/>
]
]
???

According to Krumm et al, Digital Learning Environments have fueled data intensive research in education more than any other data.

.panel[.panel-name[Games+]

.pull-left[Games and Simulations:
- Captures real-time interactions
- Cognitive outcomes
- Behavior outcomes
- Affective outcomes

]

.pull-right[

]
]
???
- Early, iterative user-testing
- help surface basic player interactions for improved core mechanics
- UI/UX and learning design
- Structure discovery and relationship mining

.panel[.panel-name[ITS]

Intelligent Tutoring Systems 
.pull-left[Three types: 
1. An expert, or domain model
2. A student model
3. An instructional, or pedagogical model

Intelligent Tutoring Systems is a type of DLE that applies AI to students interactions in the digital system.

- has three models, an expert, or domain model, which organizes the skills and strategies in the domain, 
a student model of what a student understands about the domain that is inferred from their performances on learning tasks and,
an instructional (pedagogical model) that includes  common mistakes and misconceptions along with a corresponding feedback strategy 


- The same data that the ITS uses to figure out how to respond to a student’s actions can also be used by human analysts to gain a detailed picture of learning processes and the behaviors learners engage in.

A Learning Management System (LMS) is an online integrated software used for creating, delivering, tracking, and reporting educational courses and outcomes. Often used as student-facing repositories of digital resources and activities,


We use Moodle at NCSU. What LMS do you use at your institution?

.panel[.panel-name[MOOCs]
.pull-left[
- Free/freemium courses, certificates, PD
- Edx
- Coursera
- Friday Institute
- Collect granular data like ITS

.pull-right[

]
???
Raise your hand if you have ever participated in a MOOC? The FI has many free MOOCs available, but there are also EDx and Coursera that you can take a MOOC at. These offer a major source for data from the large numbers of participants.

# Administrative Data

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[A.D.]

Types of State and Federal systems used in schools and districts to collect and store information to deliver some *sort* of service.
.pull-right[
<img src="img/Admin_LA.png" height="300px"/>
]
]
???
Administrative Data is the second type of data fueling data intensive research.
Used in Schools, at district level and throughout most states.

.panel[.panel-name[SIS]

.pull-left[
- Student level - Academic Performance
- Teacher & Administrator facing repository
- Technology-based intervention

]

.pull-right[
<img src="img/Admin_LA.png" height="300px"/>
]
]
???
**Student information systems**
Can be at the Student level or Teacher and Administrator level of student demographic and learning-outcome data.

- A ready source of data on educational outcomes (e.g., grades) and demographic information, which can play a role in evaluations of technology-based interventions as well as early warning system research 


.panel[.panel-name[SLDS]

.pull-left[
- Connects state-wide
- Accountability and reporting

]

.pull-right[
<img src="img/Admin_LA.png" height="300px"/>
]
]
???
**statewide longitudinal data systems**
- standardized test performances, attendance, and major behavioral infractions.
- unique statewide identifier for every student
- Ability to link state K12 with HEd system; storage of each student’s demographic characteristics and enrollment history and scores on state accountability tests
- Data infrastructure to examine “educational outcomes at the scale of an entire state” p.34

State  level  and  university-based  researchers  increasingly  leveraged  these  data  for  both  accountability  and  reporting  purposes  as  well  as  district-and  school-improvement purposes.
