## What is R Markdown?

## 1. Introduction

Let's get familiar with the R Markdown layout and syntax.
    
### 1.1 YAML Heading

Yaml is a data serialization language. It contains, title, author, dates, type of document etc. YAML is picky!

Check out this site on[Yamll heading](https://zsmith27.github.io/rmarkdown_crash-course/lesson-4-yaml-headers.html) by @Smith.

### 1.2 R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, webpage and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> or [The R Markdown: the definitive guide] (https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can also press `ctrl`+`shift`+`k`

### 1.2a. Markdown Syntax

R Markdowns syntax is based off of [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html). 

##### Headers

    + # One
    + ## Two
    + ### Three
    + #### Four
    + ##### Five

##### Bullet points
Bullet points can be used with a `single dash` or a `plus sign`

> Outcomes:

- Learn R Markdown.
    + Learn about Yaml heading.
    + Learn R Markdown Syntax.
- Learn how to read in data.
- Learn to wrangle data.


### 1.3. Add a Code Chunk
1. Menu Bar > 'Code' > 'insert chunk'

2. Add a code chunk by holding down `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`


## 2. WorkFlow Recap

### 3.1 Workflow
Each organization may have a familiar workflow. In Learning Analytics we use a five step process:

## 0. Introduction

Provide a brief overview or case study.

- Include your R1: *research questions!*

## 1. Prepare

Load Packages

```{r warning =FALSE, message=FALSE}

#Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


## 2. Wrangle


### a. *Import Data*

#### Data Source #1: Log Data

Log-trace data is data generated from our interactions with digital technologies, such as archived data from social media postings. In education, an increasingly common source of log-trace data is that generated from interactions with LMS and other digital tools.

The data we will use has already been "wrangled" quite a bit and is a summary type of log-trace data: the number of minutes students spent on the course. While this data type is fairly straightforward, there are even more complex sources of log-trace data out there (e.g., time stamps associated with when students started and stopped accessing the course).


Let's use the `read_csv()` function from {readr} to import our `log-data.csv` file directly from our data folder and name this data set `time_spent`, to help us to quickly recollect what function it serves in
this analysis:

```{r}
#load with read_csv package
time_spent <- read_csv("~/RProj22/foundation_labs_2022/foundation_lab_2/data/log-data.csv")
```

Now let's load it with the {here} package.

```{r}
#load with here package
time_spent <- read_csv(here("data", "log-data.csv"))

#inspect data
time_spent
```

#### Data Source #2: Academic Achievement Data


We'll load the data in the same way as earlier but take a quick peek but including the name of our data frame in the code chunk as well:

```{r}
#load data 2: Academic Achievement
gradebook <- read_csv(here("data", "gradebook-summary.csv"))

#inspect data with glimpse
glimpse(gradebook)
```

#### Data Source #3: Self-Report Survey

The third data source is a self-report survey. This was data collected
before the start of the course. The survey included ten items, each
corresponding to one of three motivation measures: interest, utility
value, and perceived competence. These were chosen for their alignment
with one way to think about students' motivation, to what extent they
expect to do well (corresponding to their perceived competence) and
their value for what they are learning (corresponding to their interest
and utility value). We'll use this in the third learning lab.

```{r}
survey <- read_csv(here("data", "survey.csv"))

#load data 3:Self-Report Survey
survey <- read_csv(here("data", "survey.csv"))

#inspect data with view - yes the "V" is capitalized
View(survey)
```

### b. Tidy data


##### Data 1: TIME SPENT
# separate course_id variable in the time-spent
```{r} 
time_spent %>%
  separate(course_id,
           c("subject", "semester", "section"))
```


```{r}
time_spent <- time_spent %>%
  separate(course_id,
           c("subject", "semester", "section"))
```

```{r}
# mutate minutes to hours on time spent and save as new variable.
time_spent <- time_spent %>% 
  mutate(time_spent_hours = time_spent / 60)
```

##### Data 2: GRADEBOOK
```{r}
# separate the course_id variable
gradebook <- gradebook %>% 
  separate(course_id, c("subject", "semester", "section"))
```

```{r}
# Mutate to a proportion, take total points earned divide by total points. Save as new variable proportion_earned.
gradebook <- gradebook %>% 
  mutate(proportion_earned = (total_points_earned / total_points_possible))

#inspect data
gradebook

```

##### Data 3: SURVEY

```{r}
#inspect data 
survey

# load janitor to clean variable names that do not match
library(janitor)

#clean column
survey <- clean_names(survey)

#inspect data to check for consistency with other data
survey

```

#### C. Join Data

```{r}
# use single join to join data sets by student_id, subject, semester and section.
joined_data <- full_join(gradebook, time_spent, 
                         by = c("student_id", "subject", "semester", "section"))

```

# join together the grade_book and log_wrangled
data_to_explore <- full_join(joined_data, survey, by = c("student_id", "subject", "section"))

#Inspect data
data_to_explore



```{r}
#mutate to change variable class from double or numeric to character
joined_data <- joined_data %>%
  mutate(student_id = as.character(student_id))

#inspect data
joined_data

#try again to together the grade_book and log_wrangled
data_to_explore <- full_join(joined_data, survey, by = c("student_id", "subject", "semester", "section"))

# inspect data
data_to_explore

# write data to file to use later
write_csv(data_to_explore, "data/data_to_explore.csv")

```

## Explore



#### A. TABLE SUMMARY
```{r}
#install package if this is first time using skimr


#load library
library(skimr)

#skim data
skim(data_to_explore)

```

```{r}
# using the `select()` and `filter()` functions. In the code chunk below,look at descriptive for just `proportion_earned` , `time_spent` and `gender`, but only for the "OcnA" and "PhysA" subjects.

data_to_explore %>% 
  select(c('subject', 'gender', 'proportion_earned', 'time_spent')) %>% 
  filter(subject == "OcnA" | subject == "PhysA") %>%
  skim()
```


#### B. DATA VIZ

```{r}
# create a histogram
data_to_explore %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_spent_hours)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)

```

```{r}
# create a scatter plot
ggplot(data_to_explore, aes(x = time_spent_hours, y = proportion_earned, color = enrollment_status)) +
  geom_point()

```

```{r}
# scatter plot facet wrap
ggplot(data_to_explore, aes(x = time_spent_hours, y = proportion_earned, color = enrollment_status)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ subject)

```

## Model


#### A. MATHMATICAL

Does time spent predict grade earned?

```{r}
# Use linear regression model
lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours, 
   data = data_to_explore)
```

```{r}
# Add predictor variable for science
lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours + int, 
   data = data_to_explore)

# save the model
m1 <- lm(proportion_earned ~ time_spent_hours + int, data = data_to_explore)

```

```{r}
#run the summary
summary(m1)

```

```{r}
#install apaTables if this is your first time

#load packages
library(apaTables)
# use the {apaTables} package to create a nice regression table that could be used for later publication.
apa.reg.table(m1, filename = "lm-table.doc")

```
